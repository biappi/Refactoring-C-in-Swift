This is a living documentation of my efforts of rewriting a Windows 32
C application in Swift. It can be a fun project and I have not seen
many resources on this particular topic, so any information could be
useful to someone.

As I am now learning the obvious, writing about programming while
programming is a much slower endeavour than programming itself, so
what should have been a quick weekend project is now this collection
of articles!


## Intended audiences

I think that this article can be of interest for people with pretty
diffent experiences:

 - Swift programmers who might want to use existing codebases
 - Programmers porting existing software on Apple platforms
 - C programmers who are "tempted" by younger languages
 - Programmers who explore existing codebases


## Follow along

This series of articles closely follows the commit-history of
[the project repository](https://github.com/biappi/Tabboz-Simulator),
you can browse the history or follow HEAD for a quick reference!


## Table of Contents

**Part 1** - [Introduction](Part%201%20-%20Introduction/README.md)
What's up with that 90s artstyle?

**Part 2** - [Zero To Build](Part%202%20-%20Zero%20To%20Build/README.md)
A commit-by-commit walkthrough on how to approach any legacy codebase


## Future steps

I started writing the article during programming, but I overestimated the
effort of "context-switching" between the two mindsets. My hat-tip to
educators who do this regularly.

After writing this two parts, I am trying to get more coding done
first, and then defer the writing later, so the project repository will
be slightly ahead.


## Contributing (?)

If you so desire, I welcome constructive contributions of any kind, I am
pretty unexperienced with writing, and this is a pretty raw writing I am
sure I've made my fair share of mistakes. It can also be a way of pushing
my momentum on writing, I don't hide writing code is funnier to me =).
